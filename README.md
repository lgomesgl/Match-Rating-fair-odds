# Match Rating  
[#DataScience]() [#MachineLearning]() [#SoccerStats]()

This project aims to predict the probabilities of a football match using **match rating**, based on statistics such as goals, shots, shots on target, and more.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure  

### `Src/match_rating`  
- **`match.py`**: Contains the `MatchRating` class, responsible for calculating the **match rating** of a league. This process uses a training dataset consisting of the first 8 seasons of each league.  
- **`regression_polynomial.py`**: After calculating the **match rating**, we apply a **Polynomial Linear Regression** to fit all match rating points within a range (-x, x).  
- **`combined_matchs.py`**: Uses the `OneModel` class to combine two match rating statistics into a single model. It utilizes data from the last 2 seasons of each league, optimizing the combination using `OptimizerAdam` and minimizing the `log loss` error.  
  - The analysis of the graphs generated by `RegressionPolynomial` shows that the most relevant statistics for prediction are **goals** and **shots on target**.  
  - The final model finds the best parameter **w1**, where:  
    $$ y = w_1 \times \text{prob\_gols} + (1 - w_1) \times \text{prob\_ts} $$

### `Src/optimizers`  
- **`optimizer.py`**: Contains optimization algorithms used in `OneModel`, such as `OptimizerAdam` and `OptimizerAdaDelta`.  

### `Src/simulations`  
ðŸŸ¢ **Initial Phase**  
- **`get_probabilities.py`**: Retrieves and normalizes the probabilities of upcoming matches based on the **match rating**.  
- **`simulation.py`**: Simulates bets using the **Monte Carlo** method via the `MonteCarlo` class, applying custom constraints to identify the best probability bets.  

### `Src/utils`  
- **`tools.py`**: Collection of utility functions, including JSON file handling.  

### `Src/weights`  
ðŸŸ¢ **Initial Phase**  
- **`classification_table.py`**: Implements a weighting system for the **match rating**, considering team rankings in the standings.  
  - Example:  
    - If a team scores against a **higher-ranked** opponent â†’ weight **1.2**.  
    - If a team scores against a **lower-ranked** opponent â†’ weight **0.8**.
